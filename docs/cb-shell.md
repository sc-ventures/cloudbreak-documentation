## Cloudbreak Shell  

The goal with the Cloudbreak Shell is to provide an interactive command line tool which:

* Supports all functionality available through the REST API and Cloudbreak web UI
* Makes possible complete automation of management task via scripts
* Includes context-aware commands
* Allows tab completion
* Supports required and optional parameters
* Includes a hint command to guide you

### Install and Start Cloudbreak Shell 

There are three ways to install and run Cloudbreak Shell:

* From the Cloudbreak VM (Recommended) 
* From the Docker Image  
* Build From Source  

> The latter two methods run the CLI on your local machine.

#### From the Cloudbreak VM

The easiest way to install and start Cloudbreak Shell is from the VM on which you have deployed Cloudbreak. On the VM, navigate to the `/var/lib/cloudbreak-deployment/` directory and execute:

<pre>cbd util cloudbreak-shell</pre>

If you would like to use Cloudbreak Shell from your local machine:

1. Execute `cbd util cloudbreak-shell-remote` on the VM where Cloudbreak is running.

2. Copy the output of the above command. 

3. Paste and execute the output on your local machine.

#### From the Docker Image

You can find the docker image and its documentation [here](https://github.com/hortonworks/docker-cloudbreak-shell).
